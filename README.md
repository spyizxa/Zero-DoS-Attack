# Zero-DoS-Attack
This python script sends random data to the given IP address via UDP

## DoS Attack?
A DoS (Denial of Service) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic. This can be achieved by sending excessive requests or data packets, causing the system to slow down or crash. In a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, multiple compromised systems are used to launch the attack, amplifying its impact. The goal of a DoS attack is to make the service unavailable to legitimate users. Such attacks can cause significant downtime and financial loss for businesses.

## Logic
**This Python code sends random data to the given IP and port via UDP Protocol and performs the type of attack we call DoS attack.**

## Usage?
```apt install python3```

```git clone https://github.com/spyizxa/Zero-DoS-Attack.git```

```cd Zero-DoS-Attack```

```python3 zerodos.py```

**You need to enter the IP, port and therad of the target.**
